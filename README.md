Subject: use case on time series analysis. 
<br>
<br>
Respected everyone,
<br>
<br>
We have been given a problem on Time series analysis. The dataset describes the minimum daily temperatures over 10 years in the city 
Melbourne, Australia. We have to build the Autocorrelation function and the Partial autocorrelation function for the daily minimum 
temperature. We first load and plot the data and then check if the data is random using lag plot. We also plot the ACF and PACF plots 
and carry out the Augmented dickey fuller test to show that the data is stationary.

<br>
Thanks and regards, <br>
Yours sincerely, <br>
